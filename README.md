# COMP503 Assignment One
#### This was the first assignment for the Auckland University of Technology's COMP503 class, Programming 2, in Semester 2 of 2020.  

This application was created to determine the certification of a student, based on their provided transcript. The
codebase was designed in an object oriented, scalable way, such that much more functionality can be added for data
computation based on the classes provided by this codebase. Currently, the application file only contains tests to
demonstrate the functionality of the package, and thus would need to be replaced with some type of robust driver class 
for actual deployment
